# Bankruptcy-Problem
This package contains four algorithms to solve the bankruptcy problem which are mooted here:

1-Proportional Solution (PROP = prop(E, c))

2-Constrained Equal Reward Solution (CEA = cea(E, c))

3-Constrained Equal Losses (CEL = cel(E, c))

4-Talmud Solution (TAL = talmud(E, c))

Also, it contains a function called bankruptcy which brings together all four of the above methods.
In all functions, E is the estate of the bankrupt firm and c is the vector of claims.
